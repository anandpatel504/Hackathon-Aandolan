# Advance Projects
**1. Alarm Clock with GUI

   Abut the Python Project
   The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter which    help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour      format.

**2. Desktop Notifier App in Python

   Python Project Idea – **A desktop notifier app** runs on your system and it will be used to send you notifications after every specific interval of time.

   You can use the libraries like **notify2**, requests, etc to build this app.

**3. Youtube Videos Downloader


- Python Project Idea – Another interesting project is to make a nice interface through which you can download youtube videos in different formats and video quality.
