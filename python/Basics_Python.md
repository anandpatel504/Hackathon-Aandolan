5. Python File Explorer

   This project is very significant as it will test your knowledge of various python concepts. We will build an app that any person can use to explore the file in the computer system. Also, in this project, we can add features like searching and cut, copy, and paste. Tkinter is the module used in python language for adding the GUI features to our program. We can use this Tkinter in this project for giving some extra effects and making it fast and easy. To create the File Explorer in Python language using Tkinter, you have to import the file dialog module from the Tkinter library. This module is used to open files and directories and saving them.

6. Music Player

   Everyone loves to listen to music. Using Python, you can also create the Music player app. Also, we can add a feature for exploring file directories and search for music. This project turns out to be the best python project by adding an interactive interface that any regular user can use. We can have advanced interface features like allowing users to browse tracks for recent searches, increase and decrease volume, display the name genre and artist of the song, etc. This project involves the idea of creating a program including python language, database management, and data processing.
